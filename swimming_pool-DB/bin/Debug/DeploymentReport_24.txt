     Possible data issues
       The column [dbo].[BookingForm].[Time] on table [dbo].[BookingForm] must be added, but the column has no default value
         and does not allow NULL values. If the table contains data, the ALTER script will not work. To avoid this issue you must
         either: add a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable the generation of smart-defaults
         as a deployment option.
       The type for column BookingDateTime in table [dbo].[BookingForm] is currently  NVARCHAR (MAX) NULL but is being changed
         to  VARCHAR (250) NOT NULL. Data loss could occur and deployment may fail if the column contains data that is
         incompatible with type  VARCHAR (250) NOT NULL.
