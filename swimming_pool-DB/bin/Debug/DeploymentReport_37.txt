     Possible data issues
       The column [dbo].[Booking].[idSwimSession] on table [dbo].[Booking] must be added, but the column has no default value
         and does not allow NULL values. If the table contains data, the ALTER script will not work. To avoid this issue you must
         either: add a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable the generation of smart-defaults
         as a deployment option.

         add a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable the generation of smart-defaults as a
         deployment option.
